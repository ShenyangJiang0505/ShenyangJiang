Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### About Me
I am an Assistant Professor of Operations Management at New York University Shanghai.

My primary research interests lie in the field of marketplace analytics. In my recent work, I analyze the operations and economics of various digital platforms using both data analytic and mathematical modeling tools. I am also interested in developing data-driven methods for analysis of online markets. My research has appeared in leading academic journals, and has been recognized with multiple awards.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Operations, Information and Decisions Department of The Wharton School, under supervision of Professors Senthil Veeraraghavan, Ken Moon and Sergei Savin.

[Work with me!] I am actively looking for Research Assistants and prospective student coauthors (on-campus or remote). Students with a strong quantitative background and/or considering applying to business Ph.D. programs are particularly welcome. You will get: (1) solid research training, (2) opportunities to work and build connections with experts in the field.
